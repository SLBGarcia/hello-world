## Likes and Dislikes
Here is a list of my *likes* and *dislikes*

### Poetry
*T.S. Eliot*

The dove descending breaks the air <br />
With flame of incandescent terror <br />
Of which the tongues declare <br />
The one discharge from sin and error. <br />
The only hope, or else despair <br />
Lies in the choice of pyre of pyre- <br />
To be redeemed from fire by fire. <br />

Who then devised the torment? Love.<br />
Love is the unfamiliar Name<br />
Behind the hands that wove<br />
The intolerable shirt of flame<br />
Which human power cannot remove.<br />
We only live, only suspire<br />
Consumed by either fire or fire.<br />
